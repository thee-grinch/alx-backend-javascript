# TypeScript

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static types, classes, interfaces, and other features to JavaScript, making it more robust and scalable for building large-scale applications.

## How to use TypeScript

To start using TypeScript in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install TypeScript globally by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    ```

2. Create a new TypeScript file with a `.ts` extension, for example `app.ts`.

3. Write your TypeScript code in the `app.ts` file using TypeScript syntax, including type annotations and other TypeScript-specific features.

4. Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    tsc app.ts
    ```

    This will generate a corresponding JavaScript file with the same name (`app.js`).

5. Use the generated JavaScript file (`app.js`) in your project as you would with any other JavaScript file.
